[User Demographics Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/bikesharing_challenge_16455645410740/UserDemographicsDashboard?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

The total number of rides exceeded 2.3 million which shows very strong ridership for the New York City program. The customer type distribution is also very encouraging, with more than 80% of users being subscribers and constituting the strong majority of user trips. About 65% of users identify as male and male users booked the greatest number of trips by far. However, subscriber trips of all genders were fairly consistent thoughout the week, which could indicate that subscribers were using the bike-sharing program as their primary mode of transportation. 

[Checkout Times Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/bikesharing_challenge_16455645410740/CheckoutTimesDashboard?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

The overwhelming majority of user trip durations were clustered between 0 and 45 minutes, with a clear peak at 5 minutes. Male and female user trips follow a similar trend line, but unknown gender user trip durations lacked a clear peak at 5 minutes and instead and had a plateau between 7 and 25 minutes. 

[Trips by Weekday per Hour Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/bikesharing_challenge_16455645410740/TripsbyWeekdayDashboard?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

Monday-Friday user trips were tightly clustered around the typical work commute time blocks (6-9 AM and 4-7 PM) and sparse during typical working hours (10 AM-3 PM). Saturday user trips were more numermous than Sunday, but both weekend days were fairly consistent throughout waking hours (7 AM-10 PM).

[Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour) Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/bikesharing_challenge_16455645410740/TripsbyGenderDashboard?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

The Trips by Gender Dashboard mostly reflects the same trends as the previous chart, but between Monday-Friday male users completed the most evening trips (7-10 PM) and were more active throughout the day on Friday. Unknown gender users mostly took trips on the weekend, particularly Saturday.

## **Summary**

The results of the analysis are very encouraging and suggest that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa could be a great success with the proper implementation. Ridership in New York City for August 2019 was extremely robust with more than 2.3 million rides taken by a strong majority of subscribers rather than one-time users. The data showed that users consistently took trips for both work (Monday-Friday commute times) and recreation (weekend days during waking hours) which suggests that the bike-sharing program is a choice mode of transportation that fits well into users' lifestyles. Male users were strongly represented in the data, with room for growth among female users and unknown gender users.

#### *Suggestions for Future Analysis*

1. A data visualization of user gender and age would be helpful to further explore why female and unknown gender users were underrepresented compared to male users in the New York City bike-sharing program. 
2. It would also be helpful to create a data visualization comparing total bikes to total users, since investors may ask how many bikes should be purchased for the Des Moines bike-sharing program.
